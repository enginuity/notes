* snapshot job/data: This refers to the entire dataset taken at a point in time. You can have multiple snapshots of the job
at different times
* incremental job/data: This refers to a data set that is generated sequentially and also potentially partitioned in the same
way. Daily jobs can be incremental if they only process logs occurring on that day.
